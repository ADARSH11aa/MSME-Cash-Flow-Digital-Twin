"""
Model 1 inference logic - shared between the training notebook and the FastAPI serving layer.

This module has NO training code. It only knows how to:

  1. Build customer-history features for a NEW invoice given past closed invoices.
  2. Build the exact model matrix used by the trained model.
  3. Run the saved RF quantile-forest model to get P10/P50/P90 days-to-payment.
  4. Apply the cold-start / sector-prior fallback consistently.

Keeping this in one file means Model 1 prediction and Model 5 SHAP explanation
use exactly the same feature-building logic.
